** Getting Started

* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app.git`.
* Want to use TypeScript? Both the `master` branch and the `typescript` branch now use TypeScript.
* Run `npm install` from the project root.
* Install the ionic CLI (`npm install -g ionic`)
* Run `ionic serve` in a terminal from the project root.
* Profit

**Note:** Is your build slow? Update `npm` to 3.x: `npm install -g npm`.
